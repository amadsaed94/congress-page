					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency is
						government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold their
						public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.</p>
					<p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and spend
						taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good and just
						governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their
						Government is doing.</p>


					<div id="demo" class="collapse">

						<p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
							effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society, and
							public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to
							become actively engaged in American government.</p>

						<p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit public
							feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

						<h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>

						<p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion
							dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist
							doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
							instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included
							Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution
							(Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
							related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

							<p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of
								the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press
								in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back
								on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers,
								Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

							<p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and is often
								linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have
								adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
								eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining independence in
								1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in
								1999).</p>

							<p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information
								Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
